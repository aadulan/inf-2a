Part E: Limitations of the System

Looking at the implementation of the the grammar. It seems that questions which
make grammatical sense do not get answered. This is because it seems that the
program cannot handle complex sentences. This then means the simple questions are
unable to get parsed which means that they do not get answered.

$$ Jack is a cool duck.
  OK
$$ Who is cool?
  Eh??
$$ Who is a duck?
  Eh??

Here is a example of this in which a complex phrase is processed but the question
asked while being simple is unable to be answered. This means an improvement can
be the program understands more complex sentences.
